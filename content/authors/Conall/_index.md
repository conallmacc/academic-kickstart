Hello there,

I am a Ph.D. student in Behavioural Neurobiology at Concordia University. My research focuses primarily on the sexual behaviours of female rats.
The main research question I'm currently working on is how an animal chooses a sexual partner and whether oxytocin plays a role in these choices. I'm also currently exploring potential roles of oxytocin in female sexual arousal and the physiological and sensory perception of sexual stimulation.

My research and professional interests do extend beyond the niche topic of rats having sex. Recently, I founded the Concordia University chapter of the Sex and Gender Science Trainee Network, an initiative of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research's Institute of Health and Gender. We aim to create a network of local research that can share resources to make it easier for others to use research subjects of both sexes. You can find updates on the Concordia University Sex and Gender Science Trainee Network here.
