And, that\u0026rsquo;s coming from someone who\u0026rsquo;s spent their whole graduate career in a neurobiology department. Why? What are social psychologists doing that we are not?\nSocial psychologists are willing to admit when they have problems. First the replication crisis, fueled by questionable (even nefarious) research practices hit them. Textbook effects either disappeared or shriveled away to nothing, once the field rolled out some large scale replication projects. Goodbye ego depletion. Goodbye priming. The upshot to finding out effects didn‚Äôt replicate is that a large collaborative correction to these textbook effects (or lack thereof) has been made. But, the rewriting of textbook effects has only made possible by the acknowledgement of the issues facing the field.\nNot all replications are equal. Sometimes it‚Äôs not really that interesting to replicate every miniscule detail of a study. Nor would it be that insightful either. Is there any point in using the same sample size and sample demographics as a previous study? Especially, when the previous sample was underpowered and more homogenized than the milk in your fridge. We expect certain effects to conceptually replicate. The hypotheses we test are typically not overly specific, e.g., we expect to see a Cohen‚Äôs d of exactly 0.64 in a sample of white male students recruited from the business school at ‚Äúinsert generic university name‚Äù etc. We test less restrictive and more conceptual hypotheses. Both are useful, but it seems to me that a conceptual replication gives more verisimilitude to a theory/hypothesis.\nCan‚Äôt catch a break. No one likes having salt and lemon juice rubbed onto their fresh wounds. Unfortunately for social psychology, they seem to get mixed up in crisis after crisis. As the replication crisis becomes cold, the generalizability crisis has just been put on the stove to start heating up. The Yarkoni Generalizability Crisis paper got a metric shit tonne of attention among psychologists on Twitter.\nIt also did the rounds on the big psychology related podcasts - Very Bad Wizards and Two Psychologists Four Beers. Despite a quick read through the paper, I got absolutely no podcast invitations. I have to admit at this point that some of the points made in the paper go above my head. But let‚Äôs distil some (but definitely not all, this is a meaty paper) of the points down because they are important:\n Effects should generalize across stimuli. For example, a Stroop effect should be consistent regardless of the font colour used. Experimental designs use a sample of stimuli out of a population of possible stimuli. And, barely anyone has given a shit about this before this paper. Just like we treat subjects/participants as a sample of a large population, we should do the same with stimuli. This means reporting the N of stimuli, and treating stimuli as a random effect, just like we do with participants. Effect sizes shrivel and the intervals grow when stimuli are incorporated as a random effect.  Agree or disagree with the points made in the paper. What I like is that people are wiling to have a productive discussion about these kind of issues in science. See the Twitter thread.\nI wrote this paper arguing that the inferential statistics we report in psychology papers are so disconnected from the hypotheses they\u0026#39;re meant to test that they may as well be made up. feedback is appreciated.https://t.co/BIJ8weUMOl\n\u0026mdash; üçßüç®üç¶Tal Yarkoni üç¶üç®üçß (@talyarkoni) November 22, 2019  These papers and responses are important metascience discussions for the field. But really there is absolutely no reason they don‚Äôt generalize to neuroscience. We want to know what effects are actually true and what aren‚Äôt. Our incentives in that regard are completely aligned.\nRinging in the neuropocalypse? So far neuroscience hasn‚Äôt plunged into crisis. Is it because we‚Äôre better scientists than psychologists? No.\nAlthough, some might think so Tell us what you really think! https://t.co/A5D4SiLI8d\n\u0026mdash; Michael Inzlicht (@minzlicht) March 31, 2020  Is it because our effects are more ‚Äúreal‚Äù because they are ‚Äúin the brain‚Äù (whatever on earth this kind of vacuous statement means)? Absolutely not.\nThere‚Äôs no reason to belief that questionable research practices and p-hacking are less frequent in neuroscience than psychology. There‚Äôs also no reason to believe our experimental design is stronger in neuroscience than in psychology. We might use cooler methods like lasers, drugs, and viruses. But we are prone to the exact same errors as other fields. We‚Äôre just as good at running underpowered studies as anyone else.\nPart of the answer seems simple: You can‚Äôt find things if you don‚Äôt look.\nNeuroscience, especially animal research, is expensive. No one is paying out big grants to run large scale replication projects. Whether they do or do not replicate is an empirical question. But considering the incentive structures in neuroscience and psychology have been very similar over time (i.e., positive publication bias, lack of interest in publishing replications, disinterest in publishing the negative replication of an important effect), I don‚Äôt see why we would be in a different boat to social psychology.\nI think it is more common than we are willing to publicly admit that highly-cited effects do not replicate. Walking around poster sessions, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard it mentioned that certain effects only replicate for certain labs. But, we never officially hear about the non-replications, just background whispers at conferences. How much resources should a lab piss away chasing the mirage of replicating X lab\u0026rsquo;s effect, when everyone who\u0026rsquo;s tried has never gotten it to work?\nShould we declare a crisis? Personally, I think we should believe way fewer of the effects we have published are real and generalizable. The first reason for this is that almost all animal research has focused on male animals. However, when we leave females out we are restricting our sampling to one half of the animal population. Yet, we may have the audacity to claim that our effects are generalizable. Come back to me when everything replicates in female animals. Not every effect should replicate in females because there are often good reasons to expect sex differences, due to different behaviours and physiology across males and females. But, we occlude ourselves from generalizable truths by omitting females from research.\nThankfully, things are changing; #SABV (sex as a biological variable) is trending. People care. The flagship journals are publishing papers highlighting this exact issue. On the other hand, some people don\u0026rsquo;t care, and will never care. But, thankfully funding agencies are implementing change from the top down.\nThe next reason is the animals themselves. I am a rat researcher. There are lots of different strains of rats, each with their own little quirks and peculiarities. I only use one strain of rat in my research. Would my effects generalize from this sample of rats to a population of rats? I‚Äôll be honest and say: I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs an empirical question, and I certainly hope so. But we know that for certain effects, they don‚Äôt generalize across strains. If you think not being able to generalize across strains is bad, wait until you hear about breeders! If you‚Äôre not familiar with rodent neuroscience, you either buy or breed your rats. There are companies that make a pretty penny from breeding rats and selling them to researchers at a premium. The last year and a half of my research life has been hell. Disappointment, frustration, just hell. I used to buy my rats from a breeding company in Quebec (I won\u0026rsquo;t name names\u0026hellip;). I study female sexual behaviour, which means I need a group of male studs that I can call upon to have sex with my female rats. The breeding company shut down the line of rats I used. So, I buy from the same company, but at a different location. As it turned out, around 50% of the new male rats refused to have sex.\nWeird\u0026hellip;\nSo, then I swapped supplier‚Ä¶ and guess what? I got some stud males.\nWhat in the world is happening at these breeding colonies that the motivation and ability to have sex was bred out of these males? And if that‚Äôs happening for something as rudimentary as sex, what‚Äôs happening to higher cognitive abilities etc.? This personal experience, combined with studies, make me worried about the generalizability of effects within a strain from different breeders. Adding to the above points, it looks like effects do not replicate in genetically similar animals depending on geographical location.\nGoing full circle and getting back to the Generalizability Crisis paper. The point of about the sampling of stimuli really made me think about current animal models. Yarkoni reminds us that we are sampling a set of stimuli for a large population of possible stimuli within a test. Expanding this to animal models, we often end up using one test to probe some cognitive, emotional, or behavioural capacity. Let‚Äôs use spatial memory as an example (sorry spatial memory folks, nothing personal). You design an experiment that tests the effect of lesions to some brain area on spatial memory. How do you test spatial memory? You use the Morris water maze. Okay, well you‚Äôve tested a sample (n = 1) of the possible population of spatial memory tests. Would the effect generalize to the other tests of spatial memory? And would the same rat behave in a consistent way across the whole population of tests? This is an empirical question.\nFor now, we might get more realistic estimates of effects by including the tests used as random effects.\nI‚Äôve seen all the above as issues in what I do for a while now. It was only once I saw them through the lens of a generalizability crisis that I saw the commonality between them. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the Twitter bubble of people I choose to follow, but I haven‚Äôt seen the same open discussion of these issues among neuroscientists as I have among social psychologists. Unless, we address these issues we\u0026rsquo;ll end up continuing with business as usual, hoping no one tries to replicate our effects, seeing the emperor without his clothes.\n","date":1587513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587600000,"objectID":"42a87a5b8685b8792bf7083a8a72e597","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/generalizability_in_neuro/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/generalizability_in_neuro/","section":"post","summary":"Social psychology had a replication and generalizability crisis.

The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of T facilitation of female sexual desire by assessing the effect of a non-aromatizable androgen (Dihydrotestosterone, DHT) in a validated animal model. Ovariectomized (OVX) Long-Evans rats were treated with oil (O) + O, 10 mcg Estradiol Benzoate (EB) + O, 10 mcg EB‚Äâ+‚Äâ500 mcg Progesterone (P), O‚Äâ+‚Äâ500 mcg DHT or 10 mcg EB‚Äâ+‚Äâ500 mcg DHT (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ12 per group). EB was administered 48‚Äâh, while P and DHT 4‚Äâh, prior to 4 sexual behavioral testing sessions in bisected unilevel pacing chambers. Appetitive behaviors (the frequencies of hops/darts and solicitations) were considered as the main outcome measure. Sexual receptivity indexes [lordosis magnitude, expressed as lordosis rating (LR), and lordosis quotient (LQ)], rejection responses, as well as mounts, intromissions and ejaculations received from the male were also coded. The probability of transition among sexual behaviors was evaluated by Transition Matrices; T-Pattern analysis was performed to detect hidden repeated temporal behavioral sequences. Preliminary analyses found no statistically significant differences between the O‚Äâ+‚ÄâO and EB‚Äâ+‚ÄâO groups, therefore we excluded the EB‚Äâ+‚ÄâO group from further analyses. Rats treated with EB‚Äâ+‚ÄâDHT displayed significantly more appetitive behaviors compared to negative controls (O‚Äâ+‚ÄâO and O‚Äâ+‚ÄâDHT), whereas no difference was observed between EB‚Äâ+‚ÄâDHT rats and positive controls (EB‚Äâ+‚ÄâP); noteworthy, a higher number of appetitive behaviors was observed in the O‚Äâ+‚ÄâDHT group compared to the O‚Äâ+‚ÄâO group. Furthermore, rats treated with EB‚Äâ+‚ÄâDHT showed significantly higher receptivity measures (LR and LQ) and received more mounts, intromissions and ejaculations compared to negative controls (O‚Äâ+‚ÄâO and O‚Äâ+‚ÄâDHT), to levels equivalent to EB‚Äâ+‚ÄâP. No differences were detected in female-male mounts or rejection responses among the 4 groups. Under a qualitative perspective, full solicitation was found exclusively in T-patterns of the EB‚Äâ+‚ÄâDHT group, which was also the only one to display T-patterns of higher order encompassing appetitive behaviors-only events. In conclusion, the administration of DHT in EB-primed OVX Long-Evans rats enhances sexual behavior measures. Specifically, DHT seems to stimulate sequences of appetitive behaviors separated from copulative/reproductive measures. Our data support an independent role of androgens in the facilitation of female sexual desire.","tags":["estrogens","androgens","female sexual behaviour"],"title":"The non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) facilitates sexual behavior in ovariectomized female rats primed with estradiol","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine A Gerson","Conall E Mac Cionnaith","Gonzalo Renato Quintana","James G Pfaus"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

In particular, 50-kHz USVs with rapid frequency oscillations, known as trills and flat-trills, in which these oscillations are flanked by a monotonic portion, are together positively correlated with appetitive behaviors such as rough and tumble play, drug and natural reward, and mating. Female rats produce 50-kHz USVs during a variety of sexual contexts, yet data are still vague as female sexual behavior is seldom studied on its own. Distributed clitoral stimulation (CLS) offers a unique approach to investigating female 50-kHz USVs as it mimics stimulation received during mating. Although CLS induces a sexual reward state, it is unknown whether CLS elicits trills and flat-trills. We addressed this question using eight ovariectomized rats, we investigated whether ovarian hormones augmented these call subtypes in response to CLS. The combined and separate effects of estradiol benzoate (EB) and progesterone (P), and oil vehicle were assessed through comparison of these call subtypes between CLS and inter-CLS interval. We found that CLS with EB‚ÄØ+‚ÄØP significantly increased call duration and rate, lowered peak frequency, and widened the bandwidth of trills. Flat-trills showed a similar pattern except for call duration. Call distribution during the CLS and inter-CLS interval suggest that trill and flat-trills may be indicative of both anticipatory and sexual reward.","tags":["Clitoris","Clitoral Stimulation"],"title":"Effects of ovarian hormones on the emission of 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations during distributed clitoral stimulation in the rat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Conall E Mac Cionnaith","Alice Lemay","Eamonn L Gomez-Perales","Genevieve Robert","Rebecca Cernik","Wayne G Brake","James G Pfaus"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Female rats that experience paced copulation with a male scented with a neutral odor selectively solicit and receive ejaculations from the scented male relative to an unscented male.

Here we tested whether female rats can be conditioned to show a sexual preference for an unscented male rat of the same strain. Female Long-Evans rats were given 10 copulatory trials with either a one-hole pacing divider or a four-hole pacing divider in a unilevel chamber with the same conspecific male (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ16). Females were then given an open-field partner preference test with the paired male versus a novel male. After two reconditioning trials females were exposed to the partner or a novel male to induce Fos expression. Females that paced with the one-hole divider received the first ejaculation and more ejaculations overall from the paired compared to novel male. Fos immunoreactivity within oxytocin neurons in the PVN, mPOA, and VMH was increased in females with a preference that were exposed to the paired male. These data indicate that female rats can form selective sexual preferences for an individual conspecific and that their formation depends on the type of pacing during conditioning. These findings further suggest the involvement of oxytocin in the display of conditioned preferences. Thus, early copulatory experience appears to determine the mating strategy used by female rats.","tags":["Oxytocin","Partner preference"],"title":"Fos expression is increased in oxytocin neurons of female rats with a sexually conditioned mate preference for an individual male rat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gonzalo R Quintana","Conall E Mac Cionnaith","James G Pfaus"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Pfaus\nPresented at Society for Neuroscience 2019 Chicago\nAccepted abstract\nSeveral studies have reported that oxytocin (OT) administration increases lordosis quotients in female rats. However, the lordosis reflex is only one of many behaviours that are important during mating in the female rat. Proceptive behaviours (i.e. solicitations and hops and darts) and pacing are important for successful impregnation. Therefore, the current study tests the effects of different doses of oxytocin on a variety of sexual behavioural measures. Thirty female Long-Evans (LE) rats were randomised to be intraperitoneally injected with 20¬µg OT, 50¬µg OT, or saline one minute prior to copulation (n = 10 per group). Females copulated with an LE male in unilevel Plexiglass pacing chambers for 30 minutes. Trials were recorded and scored for: female entries to the male compartment, the latency to return to the male after leaving the male‚Äôs compartment, solicitations, hops and darts, intromissions and ejaculations received, and the amount of time spent with a male. All behaviours were analysed with one-way ANOVAs, followed by Holm-adjusted group comparisons. Females treated with 50¬µg OT took longer to return to the male chamber and made fewer entries to the male‚Äôs compartment compared to the 20¬µg OT group. They also received fewer intromissions and ejaculations. Additionally, females treated with 50¬µg OT made fewer hops and darts and fewer solicitations than females given 20¬µg OT. Conversely, 20¬µg OT females made more proceptive behaviours and entries to the male compartment compared to 50¬µg OT females. There was also a trend for females given 20¬µg OT to make more solicitations and hops and darts than saline treated females. Thus, OT may acutely facilitate female sexual behaviour, but these effects are dose dependent; 20¬µg OT facilitates sexual behaviours whereas 50¬µg OT is inhibitory.\n","date":1572393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572393600,"objectID":"e7813b3e3edabf28cd2f98db18c79d76","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posters/sfn2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posters/sfn2019/","section":"posters","summary":"Oxytocin acutely affects female rat sexual behaviour","tags":["oxytocin","female sexual behaviour","sexual reward"],"title":"The facilitating effects of acute oxytocin treatment on pacing and proceptive sexual behaviours are dose-dependent","type":"posters"},{"authors":["Gonzalo R Quintana","Morgan Birrel","Sarah Marceau","Narges Kalantari","James Bowden","Yvonne Bachoura","Eric Borduas","Valerie Lemay","Jason W Payne","Conall Mac Cionnaith","James G Pfaus"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This conditioned ejaculatory preference (CEP) can be shifted by systemic administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone (NAL) during training, such that NAL-trained males distribute their ejaculations to females without the cue, relative to saline (SAL)-trained males. The present study examined two brain sites, the medial preoptic area (mPOA) or ventral tegmental area (VTA), where the opioid reward state might be induced. Sexually na√Øve Long-Evans males were implanted with bilateral guide cannula aimed at either site before they underwent multi-ejaculatory conditioning trials at 4-day intervals with sexually receptive females that bore either an almond odor or rodent tethering jacket. Infusions of NAL (1 Œºl/side) or SAL (1 Œºl/side) were made prior to each conditioning trial. All males were infused with SAL prior to a final open-field choice test with two sexually receptive females, one scented and the other unscented, or one jacketed and the other unjacketed. Males previously conditioned with SAL in either region showed significant CEP. In contrast, prior infusions of NAL to the mPOA shifted the preference towards the unfamiliar female, whereas prior infusions to the VTA abolished CEP for the odor. Subsequent detection of Fos protein induced by the cue showed that, relative to SAL-treated males, prior experience with NAL in the mPOA suppressed Fos in both the mPOA and VTA, whereas prior experience with NAL in to the VTA suppressed Fos in the VTA alone. Opioid antagonism in the mPOA produces a state of non-reward whereas in the VTA, it produces a state in which the odor does not acquire incentive properties.","tags":["Sexual reward","Male sexual behaviour","Partner prefernce"],"title":"Differential disruption of conditioned ejaculatory preference in the male rat based on different sensory modalities by micro-infusions of naloxone to the medial preoptic area or ventral tegmental area","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gonzalo R.

The famous sex researcher Alfred Kinsey said: ‚ÄúThe only unnatural sex act is that which can‚Äôt be performed.‚Äù\nFrom foot fetishes to the kinkiest outfit or habits, fetishes are an endless rainbow of preferences and practices. Although human studies on fetishes and atypical sexual interest are few, case studies and research on non-human animal behaviour have revealed some insights about them and how they may develop.\nIn fetishism, the subject of the desire is not necessarily related to sexual intercourse, yet the fetish drives a person‚Äôs sexual arousal, fantasies and preferences. Fetishes can be part of a healthy and playful sexual life for individuals and couples, and also forms the basis of some sexual subcultures.\nUnfortunately, fetishes have often wrongly been associated with sexual deviancy, making it easy to feel weird or shame about them. Many of us are quick to judge things we do not understand or experience. When it comes to sex, we can believe that things we don‚Äôt do are weird, wrong or even disgusting.\nPhoto by Shibari Kinbaku from Pixabay\nThe Pride marches taking place this summer began as a social movement against repressive and discriminatory practices against LGBTQ people following the Stonewall riots in New York City in 1969. Fifty years later, Pride month has become a commemoration and celebration of sexual minorities and diversity.\nLet‚Äôs take a look under the covers together to paint a more positive view of these so-called ‚Äúperversions.‚Äù We all may have a kink or two. So why not feel more accepting of our more obscure sexual desires?\nWhat are fetishes? Fetishes are not just about whips and leather, but part of a natural curiosity to explore the unknown territories of our sexuality.\nA lot of the early science claimed fetishes were sexual abnormalities or perversions. However, most researchers and clinical practitioners now only consider fetishes to be harmful if they cause distress, physical harm or transgress consent.\nScientists have recently begun to understand how some fetishes develop. Several animal studies and case reports on humans suggest that early imprinting and Pavlovian or classical conditioning can shape the formation of fetishes. We believe learning from experiences plays a large role in forming fetishes.\nFrom a Pavlovian conditioning perspective, fetishes are seen as the product of associating early and rewarding sexual experiences with objects, actions or body parts that are not necessarily sexual. This is perhaps why different people have different fetishes.\nAs for early imprinting, the best example comes from a study in which newborn goats and sheep were cross-fostered by a mother of another species. Goats were mothered by sheep, and the sheep mothered by goats. The results showed male goats and sheep had sexual preferences for females of the opposite species, meaning the same species as their adopting mothers, while females on the other hand were more fluid in their choices and were willing to have sex with males of both species.\nPhoto by vaun0815 on Unsplash.\nThis study shines some light on sex differences in human fetishes, as men with fetishes tend to vastly outnumber women with fetishes.\nThese sex differences appear to be explained solely by differences in sexual urges, where men tend to show higher arousal or less repulsion towards various ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù sexual acts than women do. This, nevertheless, does not imply men have more psychological disorders.\nFetish-related disorders\nFetishes, just like any other thing in life, can be taken to where it may be a little ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù They may not only be preferred, but also needed in the expression of sexual arousal, which can impair the preferred pattern of arousal or performance.\nFetish-related disorders are characterized by the expression of two main criteria: recurrent and intense sexual arousal from either the use of objects or highly specific body part(s) that are not genitalia manifested by fantasies, urges or behaviours; those which can cause great distress or impairment of their intimacy, social or occupational life.\nSome are particularly troubling, like exhibitionism or frotteurism. These paraphilias are believed to be distortions of normal sexual interactions with others. Sadly, both of them still remain poorly understood.\nAs previously mentioned, if by some reason we can establish associations that can drive our arousal through learning experiences, research has also shown that these associations can be ‚Äúerased.‚Äù However, this process can be quite slow, difficult to change and susceptible of being spontaneously triggered by familiar cues.\nNo definition of normal\nFetishes have the potential of enhancing or expanding the repertoire of sensations we experience during sex. In fact, experimental data shows that animals become more sexually aroused when they learn to associate sex with fetish-like cues.\nInstead of focusing on what you should like or what should get you off or not, you‚Äôre better off wondering how that thing suits you or your partner. Normality falls within blurry lines, and it is up to you to expand its limits or not.\nThere is no exact definition of what constitutes normal or healthy. These definitions are highly dependent of the context (historical time and culture).\nWe get caught up with what appears to be more frequent, healthy, natural or normal: but what about what feels right?\nSo how do you know if you have a fetish? If there is consent and respect, it really doesn‚Äôt matter what you do between the bed sheets, on the kitchen table or on that secret hidden spot.\nPerhaps you don‚Äôt have a fetish. But it‚Äôs never too late to try.\nAs North Americans celebrate Pride this summer, we should take it as a reminder of our colourful sexual diversity ‚Äîand also the infinite ways to have sex, with nothing unnatural about any of them.\nWe believe all people should be allowed to express their sexuality and embrace it without the weight of stereotypes or ‚Äúnormal‚Äù standards to live by. Life is too short to not make the best out of it, especially when it comes to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh.\n","date":1560988800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560988800,"objectID":"41a824d37f7b0a20f6d99652e7539909","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/fetishes/","publishdate":"2019-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/fetishes/","section":"post","summary":"The famous sex researcher Alfred Kinsey once said the only unnatural sex act is one that can‚Äôt be performed..","tags":["Sexual behaviours","Sex science"],"title":"There are infinite ways to have sex \u0026 there‚Äôs nothing unnatural about any of them","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Conall E.

Female rats who repeatedly copulate with almond scented males selectively solicit, and preferentially receive the scented male‚Äôs ejaculations, relative to an unscented male. In female prairie voles, partner preference formation is blocked by the administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist and is facilitated by oxytocin. Previous studies examining sexually conditioned partner preference in the female rat have typically required ten conditioning trials prior to partner preference emerging. The aim of this study is to examine whether oxytocin facilitates faster formation of sexually conditioned partner preference in female rats.\nMethods: Hormonally-primed ovariectomised Long-Evans female rats (N=72) will be given either one, five, or ten sexual conditioning trials with an almond scented male prior to an open-field partner preference test. Females will be injected intraperitoneally with either 20¬µg of oxytocin or saline one minute before conditioning trials (n=12). In the partner preference test, an almond scented and an unscented male will be tethered to opposite corners of the open field, allowing the female to copulate preferentially with either male. Partner preference tests will be recorded and then scored by a blinded observer for 1) solicitations made toward the scented and unscented males, 2) ejaculations received by the female from each male, and 3) the female‚Äôs choice for first solicitation and ejaculation.\nApproach for statistical analysis: Each behaviour will be analysed with a 3x2x2 three-way mixed ANOVA. We hypothesise a three-way interaction between drug treatment, number of conditioning trials, and the type of male (scented vs unscented). Specifically, females given one and five conditioning trials with oxytocin will solicit and receive more ejaculations from the scented male compared to the unscented male, and this effect will not be present in the saline treated groups. At ten trials we expect no differences in solicitations made toward and ejaculations received from the scented male between the oxytocin and saline treated females. The choice for first ejaculation and solicitation will be analysed using œá2 tests. Sample size was calculated to achieve 90% power with a medium effect size.\n","date":1555718400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555718400,"objectID":"7b58d6f301ae91b6e6409ccab8fa12ee","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posters/bna2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posters/bna2019/","section":"posters","summary":"The effect of i.p. oxytocin administration on sexually conditioned partner preference","tags":["oxytocin","female sexual behaviour","sexual reward"],"title":"The facilitating effect of oxytocin on sexually conditioned partner preference in the female rat","type":"posters"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Conall E.

Pfaus\nPresented at Society for Neuroscience 2018 San Diego\nAccepted abstract A growing body of evidence shows important roles of Pavlovian learning in sexual partner selection. Female rats who repeatedly undergo paced copulation with almond scented males selectively solicit, and preferentially receive the scented male‚Äôs ejaculations relative to those of an unscented male. Exposure to conditioned scented partner cues has been shown to induce Fos protein within oxytocin (OT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Whether female rats can be conditioned to show a partner preference for an individual male rat has not yet been shown. The aim of this study was to test whether female rats could form a conditioned preference for an individual male rat. Females were given paced copulation with either a one-hole divider or a fourhole divider in a unilevel pacing chamber but always copulated with the same partner during conditioning trials (N = 32). After 10 trials, females were then given an open-field partner preference test with the partner male and a novel male. Females underwent two reconditioning trials and were then exposed to the partner or a novel male for an hour to induce Fos protein, after which we examined regions of the brain associated with incentive motivation, sexual behaviour, and bonding (nucleus accumbens core and shell, medial preoptic area, and ventral tegmental area). Fos protein was also examined in OT-labelled neurons within the PVN and supraoptic nucleus (SON). Behavioural results indicated that females in the one-hole pacing group received the first ejaculation more frequently and more ejaculations overall from the partner male compared to the novel male. The four-hole pacing group did not display a conditioned partner preference. Preliminary counts in the PVN (n = 3) did not show a significant difference in Fos/OT co-labelled cells, but, there is a trend toward an interaction between the male females were exposed to and the pacing group (p \u0026lt; .10, Œ∑¬≤p =.141). Preliminary result suggest this interaction is being driven by increased activation in females in the one-hole group exposed to the partner male. The behavioural data suggest that pacing is necessary but not sufficient for the formation of conditioned partner preference for an individual male rat. We expect that exposure to the partner in the one-hole pacing will show differential Fos expression compared to females exposed to a novel male and will not be present in the four-hole group. If this effect is found it would suggest that activation of OT cells in the PVN are likely involved in the display of conditioned partner preference for individual male rats as well as for conditioned odour cues.\n","date":1541376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541376000,"objectID":"14d9c66975ae58898afddc10b59ccef1","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posters/sfn2018/","publishdate":"2018-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posters/sfn2018/","section":"posters","summary":"Oxytocin neurons are activated by males associated with past copulation","tags":["oxytocin","female sexual behaviour","sexual reward"],"title":"Fos expression in female rats with a conditioned partner preference for an individual male","type":"posters"},{"authors":["Gonzalo R.

We work as psychology of sexual behaviour researchers in the lab of Dr. James Pfaus at Concordia University and were interested to explore the ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù of clitoral versus vaginal orgasms.\nWe conducted a literature review on the current state of the evidence and different perspectives on how this phenomenon occurs in women. Particularly, the nature of a woman‚Äôs orgasm has been a source of scientific, political and cultural debate for over a century. Although science has an idea of what orgasms are, we are still quite uncertain as to how they occur.\n Orgasms are one of the few phenomena that occur as a result of a highly complex interaction of several physiological and psychological systems all at once. While there may be evolutionary reasons why men are more likely to orgasm during sex, we shouldn‚Äôt doom ourselves to this idea. Indeed, part of the problem lies in what happens in the bedroom.\nWe all have different preferences when it comes to what we like in bed. But one commonality we share is that we know when we orgasm and when we do not. We don‚Äôt always orgasm every time we have sex, and that can be just fine, because we may have sex for many different reasons. However, studies repeatedly show that women reach climax less often than men do during sexual encounters together.\nFor example, a national survey conducted in the United States showed that women reported one orgasm for every three from men. Heterosexual males said they achieved orgasm usually or always during sexual intimacy, 95 per cent of the time.\nThe gap appears to become narrower among homosexual and bisexual people, where 89 per cent of gay males, 88 per cent bisexual males, 86 per cent lesbian women, and 66 per cent of bisexual women orgasm during sexual interactions.\nWhen we take a closer look at what might explain the orgasm gap, we can see the type of relationship we have with our partner matters. If you are in an established committed relationship, the gap tends to close, but it widens during casual sex.\nThat is, women in a committed relationship report reaching an orgasm as often as 86 per cent of the time, whereas women in casual sex encounters report they orgasm only 39 per cent of the time. Furthermore, heterosexual women achieve orgasm easily and regularly through masturbation.\nLikewise, the more knowledge about the female genitalia (especially about the clitoris) the partner has, the higher the likelihood is for women to orgasm more frequently. Finally, and most importantly, the respondents reported the most reliable practice to achieve an orgasm for women is oral sex.\nWe don‚Äôt know why this gap occurs in casual sex versus sex in a committed relationship, but part of it might be how we communicate what we want sexually, what we expect sexually and attitudes toward sexual pleasure.\nWhat sex-ed did not teach you\nFormal education teaches us a vast amount of relevant topics in school, yet sexual education has been and is still a matter of (moral) debate. For many of us, sexual education covered reproductive biology and how not to get pregnant or contract sexually transmitted infections.\nSex-ed has been focused on preventing kids from having sex. ‚ÄúAlways use condoms‚Äù was sometimes the most progressive sex-ed message. Education is now progressing into teaching what sex is about and how to engage in ethical and respectful sex, but that is still not the whole picture. How about pleasure or how to have fun and to explore what we like, how to communicate to our partners and many other crucial aspects of intimate life?\nThe key to the ultimate goal of enjoying ourselves is to know what you and your partner want and how to satisfy each other. Consequently, incomplete and biased sex education fails both men and women, omitting the fact sex is not only for reproduction but also for enjoyment.\nMaybe the first thing we should learn about sex is that it is one of the favourite pastimes of adults. Preventing it from happening will only increase the likelihood of future generations engaging in it more, only with less knowledge about to how get the most out of it.\nSome advice for sexual partners\nOur first reaction to the orgasm gap may be to point fingers and find someone to blame: Cultural attitudes, religion, society, the educational system, your ex. Certainly, anyone would agree that the gap is a multifactorial phenomenon.\nStatistics do not count when it comes to your own intimacy. In bed, it‚Äôs you and your partner(s), and that is what matters. We cannot create nor do we trigger orgasms in our partners. We can only help to make them easier, more fun and more enjoyable for them.\nEven if you may have a good idea of what your partner may want in bed, what people like varies a great deal. Thus, understanding what a partner wants, how, when, where, or for how long, requires openness, trust and, most importantly, communication.\nThese key ingredients may be what‚Äôs missing in both casual and long-term encounters. We could all be more open and humble, and acknowledge that with a good attitude and a good teacher, everyone gets better at it.\nYour sexual prowess and ability to satisfy grows with practice; it goes without saying that our sexual lives should improve beyond previous negative experiences.\nThere may be very few things in this world that perhaps all people in this world enjoy, and orgasms are among them. But the enjoyment of sex is not the race to climb to the top of the mountain. Instead, it is the enjoyment of getting there.\nSo what can you do? Talk, be confident and pay attention to your partner.\nSatisfaction means very different things for different people. What really matters is what you and your partner(s) want. Shattering the climax glass ceiling is a team effort. Sex is fun ‚Äî and everyone has something to learn about it.\n","date":1521504000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521504000,"objectID":"cc5c15f4088ddc7a66f227f40f6afcb4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/orgasm_gap/","publishdate":"2018-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/orgasm_gap/","section":"post","summary":"Studies show that women reach climax less often than men do during sexual encounters together.","tags":["orgasm","sexual reward","sex"],"title":"The orgasm gap and what sex-ed did not teach you","type":"post"},{"authors":["James G Pfaus","Gonzalo R Quintana","Conall E.
